## Devlogs
### W1
Hello world!

### W2
Create future Devlog sub-headers with the three # symbols, then write your Devlogs below them.

1. The r, g, and b variables are floats instead of ints, bools or
strings because rgb values can only go from 0.0 - 1.0.

2. The "_bounce" variable is an int instead of a float, bool, or string
because each point added is by one which is a whole number and ints store
whole numbers.

3. I didn't get the error because I fixed it immediately. The error occurs
because the original commented line of code was missing a semi-colon at 
the end.
